Here is a list of Hugging Face Pipelines for NLP. For some reason these are difficult to find on Hugging Face’s own documentation, so I am listing them here for my own convenience (and yours).

    sentiment-analysis
    feature-extraction (convert text into a vector)
    ner (named entity recognition)
    text-generation
    fill-mask (“article spinning”)
    summarization
    translation (e.g. translation_en_to_fr)
    question-answering
    zero-shot-classification
    conversational (“chat bot”)
    text2text-generation

Non-text pipelines:

    image-classification
    image-segmentation
    object-detection
    audio-classification
